# Conformal Prediction for STL Runtime Verification

This repository contains the code, presentation, and research paper for our project on **Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) Runtime Verification**, completed as part of the **CS637 - Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems** course.

## About the Project

Runtime verification is a lightweight formal method used to verify system behaviors during execution. In this project, we explore the use of **Conformal Prediction** to enhance the robustness of STL-based runtime verification. Conformal prediction provides a statistically valid way to associate confidence levels with predictions, offering a significant advantage in the context of runtime safety-critical systems.

### Key Highlights:
- **Paper:** Presented the theoretical framework and case studies illustrating the application of conformal prediction for STL runtime verification.
- **Implementation:** Recreated the code from the paper, ensuring reproducibility and better understanding of the methods.
- **Presentation:** Summarized the paper's contributions, challenges, and our implementation results during the course.
